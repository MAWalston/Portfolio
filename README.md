1A. The project is showing what food products were sold the most and the problem it was solving was hwoto organize the grocery store so that the most bought foods were in the front.
2. What did you do particularly well?
2A. I don't think I did anything particularly well, I struggled quite a bit making the code work correctly.If I had to pick one thing I did well it would be trying multiple ways to make this code work correctly. 
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
3A. I could enhanve the code with more details of organization or implement where to put the food products in a certain layout of store. 
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
4A. I found the most challenging was getting the menu options to link with the correct resonses and learning how to imput the text file into the code. 
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
5A. The three skills I can take from this project and put into the other is debugging, organization of the code and attention to detail. 
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
6A. I made this program maintainable due to keeping it short as possible. I made sure to keep this project readable by keeping the functions straight forward and not have multiple responses per request. The code could be more adaptable if there were more specifications to the code.
